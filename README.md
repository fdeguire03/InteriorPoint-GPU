# InteriorPoint-GPU
GPU-aware interior point solver for convex optimization problems

See demo.ipynb for overview of usage. Init method of LPSolver also describes all of the input parameters.

Currently implemented for LPs, QPs, and SOCPs. Dedicated solver using ADMM for LASSO problems in parallel.
